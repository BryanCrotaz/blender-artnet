Implement fixture definitions based on the GDTF format (https://gdtf-share.com/wiki/Main_Page)
    Requires 3DS import support for importing models which is not implemented yet in Blender 2.83
    
Implement ArtTimeCode timecode output for controlling timecode shows in rendertime (https://art-net.org.uk/structure/time-keeping-triggering/arttimecode/)

Implement assignment of any incoming Art-Net values to any numeric input
    Would require a value mapping menu/window with conversion from int8 to any number scale. 
    Preferrably with coarse/fine/ultra-fine combination of incoming channels to generate int16 & int 32.
