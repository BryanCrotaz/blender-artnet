# blender-artnet
Blender script to push artnet data to Evee lights. Runs at 30fps with Evee rendering in the viewport.

Combine with QLCPlus to have a fully open source lighting system

Replace `FixtureTypes` and `FixtureUniverses` with your data to use it in your own animations

# Contributions wanted
I'd like to turn this into an addon with a UI editor in each light which allows you to set a fixture type, universe and base address.

It also needs conversion to classes, but this is my first ever piece of python so I'm not confident to do that
